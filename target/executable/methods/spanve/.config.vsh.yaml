summary: "Spanve is a non-parametric statistical approach based on modeling space\

description: "The depiction of in situ gene expression through spatial transcriptomics\
  \ facilitates the inference of cell \nfunction mechanisms. To build spatial maps\
  \ of transcriptomes, the first and crucial step is to \nidentify spatially variable\
  \ (SV) genes. However, current methods fall short in dealing with \nlarge-scale\
  \ spatial transcriptomics data and may result in a high false positive rate due\
  \ to the \nmodeling of gene expression into parametric distributions. \nThis paper\
  \ introduces Spanve (https://github.com/zjupgx/Spanve), a non-parametric statistical\
  \ approach \nbased on modeling space dependence as a distance of two distributions\
  \ for detecting SV genes. \nThe high computing efficiency and accuracy of Spanve\
  \ is demonstrated through comprehensive benchmarking. \nAdditionally, Spanve can\
  \ detect clustering-friendly SV genes and spatially variable co-expression, \nfacilitating\
  \ the identification of spatial tissue domains by an imputation.   \n"

  summary: "Spatially variable genes (SVGs) are genes whose expression levels vary\
    \ significantly across different spatial regions within a tissue or across cells\
    \ in a spatially structured context."
  description: "Recent years have witnessed significant progress in spatially-resolved\
    \ transcriptome profiling techniques that simultaneously characterize cellular\
    \ gene expression and their physical position, generating spatial transcriptomic\
    \ (ST) data. The application of these techniques has dramatically advanced our\
    \ understanding of disease and developmental biology. One common task for all\
    \ ST profiles, regardless of the employed protocols, is to identify genes that\
    \ exhibit spatial patterns. These genes, defined as spatially variable genes (SVGs),\
    \ contain additional information about the spatial structure of the tissues of\
    \ interest, compared to highly variable genes (HVGs).\n\nIdentification of spatially\
    \ variable genes is crucial to for studying spatial domains within tissue microenvironmnets,\
    \ developmental gradients and cell signaling pathways. In this task we attempt\
    \ to evaluate various methods for detecting SVGs using a number of realistic simulated\
    \ datasets with diverse patterns derived from real-world spatial transcriptomics\
    \ data using scDesign3. Synthetic data is generated by mixing a Gaussian Process\
    \ (GP) model and a non-spatial model (obtained by shuffling mean parameters of\
    \ the GP model to remove spatial correlation between spots) to generate gene expressions\
    \ with various spatial variability. For more details, please refer to our [manuscript](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.12.02.569717v1)\
    \ and [Github](https://github.com/pinellolab/SVG_Benchmarking).\n"
